            I am a Web Developer located around Oklahoma City. I enjoy building
            custom PC's, coding, cooking, and listening to music. I spend much
            of my free time failing to please my cats ðŸ˜¹. The rest of my time I
            do a subpar job at pleasing the rest of my family ðŸ˜‰.

            I have a background in customer support, which has helped me to code
            with a focus on the user experience. Though I would consider myself
            primarilly a front end developer, having mostly worked on small
            teams has given me oppurtunities to work across the full stack.
